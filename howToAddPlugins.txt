To add a plugin, first download the plugin .jar file (Make sure that it is for 1.8.8). 
Next, go to the server/plugins and add the file to /plugins. e.g. /server/plugin yourplugin
If you restart the codespace, new folders with the name of the plugin should appear.
If not, try moving the .jar around and make sure it is not in /server/plugins/pluginmetrics
